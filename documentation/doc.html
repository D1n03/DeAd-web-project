      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        DeAd (Detention Administration) is a web application designed to
        facilitate the management of visitation schedules for individuals
        incarcerated in a prison. This document outlines the functionality of
        DeAd and its underlying encoding mechanisms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DeAd (Detention Admin) is a web app crafted to oversee visits for
        incarcerated individuals, aiming to streamline the visitation process
        efficiently while maintaining reliability in recording crucial visit
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app will capture visitor information, including identity, photo,
        relationship with the inmate (relative, friend, lawyer), and visit
        purpose. Additionally, it will log meeting date, nature, duration (e.g.,
        trial appeal consultation, friendly visit), items provided to the
        inmate, and other pertinent data.
      </p>
      <p>
        DeAd's main goal is to ensure precise and secure visit records within
        prisons, benefiting staff, inmates, and visitors alike. It offers a
        simplified process for visit booking, modifications, and cancellations,
        minimizing errors or misunderstandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of DeAd's features
        and functionalities, along with system requirements and user
        instructions. It also details security measures safeguarding sensitive
        information, prioritizing privacy and confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        To encapsulate, DeAd presents a user-friendly solution for effectively
        managing prison visits, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability for
        all pertinent stakeholders.

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The DeAd application consists of fourteen web pages, adhering to
        specific methodologies for structuring web applications. With a logical
        and well-designed architecture, the application provides clear and
        user-friendly features for all users. The subsequent lines will
        delineate the architecture of each page.
      </p>
      <p>The application pages share the same header structured as follows:</p>
      <section class="component-1">
        <h3>The header</h3>
        <p>
          The application header comprises a single area, with the navigation
          bar positioned on the right side. This navigation bar facilitates
          access to the home, about, help, and contact pages.

        <h3>The <code>Index</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          The primary page of the application comprises a solitary "first"
          section. The central element within this section is the button
          designated for scheduling a visit. If the user is logged, based on his
          function, the user will be redirected to the Vistor Main or Admin Main
          page.

          To schedule a visit, users must log in to their account in our

          containing two fields. If a user already possesses an account, they
          will input their email address and password, then click the "Log in"
          button on the bottom. Conversely, if a user lacks an account, they
          should press the "Sign up" button at the bottom to create one. Lastly,
          there is a section dedicated in case a user forgot the password of the
          account.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <p>
        The primary actors engaged with the web application include users and
        the administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user, you will have the capability to perform the following
        actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user will be able to schedule a visit by logging into an existing
          account. Upon successful login, the user will be prompted with a menu
          to either create a visit, provide information about an active visit,
          or view their visit history.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user will have the capability to access the page dedicated to
          general information about the prison and also the page about the
          functionalities of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user can view their profile and update information such as name,
          email, or photo. They can also change their password. Additionally, if
          the user is logged in or not, they can provide feedback or request
          information through the contact page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The administrator assumes the role of the second main actor. They are
        depicted through the following actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The administrator actor shares all actions of a user actor, except for
          creating a visit, providing details about the visit and viewing the
          history of their own visits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional actions for the administrator would include the ability to
          delete or edit user-related information, manage information about
          inmates (adding, deleting, or editing), delete or edit data about the
          visits and potentially download data based on various criteria related
          to inmates, users and visits.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we used the following technologies: HTML, BEM, SASS,
        and a RESTful API.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Initially, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) played a pivotal role as
            it provided a framework for incorporating elements onto the webpage,
            including titles, paragraphs, images, etc. Additionally, we
            maintained a structured HTML format, emphasizing the importance of
            the three fundamental tags: <code>html</code>, <code>body</code>,
            and <code>head</code>. To further enhance clarity and coherence, we
            employed semantic tags such as <code>main</code>,
            <code>section</code>, <code>nav</code>, and others.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Secondly, we implemented the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
            methodology, which enabled us to assign distinctive names to element
            classes. This approach ensured that we avoided conflicts arising
            from CSS class names throughout the project. Furthermore, by
            employing concise names, we established a stronger linkage between
            the HTML and CSS code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Thirdly, the implementation of Sass proved instrumental in
            optimizing our CSS code generation process. By harnessing Sass, we
            streamlined organization, minimized code redundancy, and harnessed
            advanced features such as mixin functions and variables to further
            enhance efficiency.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lastly, we integrated a RESTful API to handle data exchange between
            the client and the server. This API facilitated CRUD operations,
            allowing us to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. By
            adhering to REST principles, we ensured a stateless, scalable, and
            modular approach to backend communication.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, DeAd (Detention Administration) is a meticulously
        designed web application aimed at simplifying the management of
        visitation schedules for incarcerated individuals. Through a
        user-friendly and simple interface, DeAd ensures precise record-keeping.
        Leveraging HTML, BEM, SASS and RESTful API technologies, the project
        exemplifies structured development methodologies. With its emphasis on
        efficiency and reliability, DeAd stands as a significant advancement in
        prison visitation management, benefiting staff, inmates, and visitors
        alike.
