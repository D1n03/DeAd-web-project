      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        DeAd (Detention Administration) is a web application designed to
        facilitate the management of visitation schedules for individuals
        incarcerated in a prison. This document outlines the functionality of
        DeAd and its underlying encoding mechanisms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DeAd (Detention Admin) is a web app crafted to oversee visits for
        incarcerated individuals, aiming to streamline the visitation process
        efficiently while maintaining reliability in recording crucial visit
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app will capture visitor information, including identity, photo,
        relationship with the inmate (relative, friend, lawyer), and visit
        purpose. Additionally, it will log meeting date, nature, duration (e.g.,
        trial appeal consultation, friendly visit), items provided to the
        inmate, and other pertinent data.
      </p>
      <p>
        DeAd's main goal is to ensure precise and secure visit records within
        prisons, benefiting staff, inmates, and visitors alike. It offers a
        simplified process for visit booking, modifications, and cancellations,
        minimizing errors or misunderstandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of DeAd's features
        and functionalities, along with system requirements and user
        instructions. It also details security measures safeguarding sensitive
        information, prioritizing privacy and confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        To encapsulate, DeAd presents a user-friendly solution for effectively
        managing prison visits, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability for
        all pertinent stakeholders.
      </p>

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The DeAd application consists of fourteen web pages, adhering to
        specific methodologies for structuring web applications. With a logical
        and well-designed architecture, the application provides clear and
        user-friendly features for all users. The subsequent lines will
        delineate the architecture of each page.
      </p>
      <p>The application pages share the same header structured as follows:</p>
      <section class="component-1">
        <h3>The header</h3>
        <p>
          The application header comprises a single area, with the navigation
          bar positioned on the right side. This navigation bar facilitates
          access to the home, about, and contact pages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="component-2">
        <h3>The <code>index.html</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          The primary page of the application comprises a solitary "first"
          section. The central element within this section is the button
          designated for scheduling a visit.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="component-3">
        <h3>The <code>login.html</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          To schedule a visit, users must log in to their account in our
          database. This leads to the "Login" page, featuring a bordered box
          containing two fields. If a user already possesses an account, they
          will input their email address and password, then click the "Log in"
          button on the bottom. Conversely, if a user lacks an account, they
          should press the "Sign up" button at the bottom to create one. Lastly,
          there is a section dedicated in case a user forgot the password of the
          account.

          confirmation. The user is required to enter their information
          accurately to proceed with the sign-up process. Additionally, there is
          a button labeled "Sign up" at the bottom of the form, which the user
          can click to submit their details and complete the registration
          process.

          visitor as needed. In the second area, users can access the list of
          visitors along with their associated information. Here, users have the
          option to delete a specific visitor, edit the information pertaining

          their information, add new entries, or remove them from the database.
          Regarding regular users, the administrator have the authority to
          delete accounts, view visitation records, and make modifications to
          visitation information. Additionally, the administrator can export

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <p>
        The primary actors engaged with the web application include users and
        the administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user, you will have the capability to perform the following
        actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user will be able to schedule a visit, which necessitates logging
          into an existing account. Upon successful login, the user will be
          prompted to input their personal information as well as the details of
          accompanying individuals. Following this, the final step involves
          providing information regarding the visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user will have the capability to access the page dedicated to
          general information about the prison and also the page about the
          functionalities of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additionally, the user possesses the capability to download reports
          regarding their visits.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final action available to a user actor is to provide feedback or
          request information through the contact page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The prison administrator assumes the role of the second main actor. They
        are depicted through the following actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The administrator actor shares all actions of a user actor, except for
          scheduling a visit, viewing the history of their own visits, and
          interacting with the contact page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional actions for the administrator would include the ability to
          delete or edit user-related information, manage information about
          inmates (adding, deleting, or editing), and potentially download data
          based on various criteria related to inmates, users, etc.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        For this project we used the following technologies: HTML, BEM and SASS.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Initially, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) played a pivotal role as
            it provided a framework for incorporating elements onto the webpage,
            including titles, paragraphs, images, etc. Additionally, we
            maintained a structured HTML format, emphasizing the importance of
            the three fundamental tags: <code>html</code>, <code>body</code>,
            and <code>head</code>. To further enhance clarity and coherence, we
            employed semantic tags such as <code>main</code>,
            <code>section</code>, <code>nav</code>, and others.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Secondly, we implemented the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
            methodology, which enabled us to assign distinctive names to element
            classes. This approach ensured that we avoided conflicts arising
            from CSS class names throughout the project. Furthermore, by
            employing concise names, we established a stronger linkage between
            the HTML and CSS code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Thirdly, the implementation of Sass proved instrumental in
            optimizing our CSS code generation process. By harnessing Sass, we
            streamlined organization, minimized code redundancy, and harnessed
            advanced features such as mixin functions and variables to further
            enhance efficiency.
